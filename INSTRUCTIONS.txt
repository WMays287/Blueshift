Blueshift disk packer - Instructions

To set up and use a project environment, just create a new folder, with a copy
of this .JAR file as the "Makefile".

The folder should also contain one .EXA file as the source code for each EXA.

To pack a new disk, call this .JAR in the terminal, with the project name as
the only argument.
